There will be 4 UBC pthread creadte in this part as requirement.
	-thread 1 - await input from keyboard
	-thread 2 - await a UDP datagram
	-thread 3 - print characters to the screen
	-threadkeyboar 4 - send data to the remote UNIX processes over the 
			network using UDP.

The mainp will check the input paramtere for port number, if the input port 
number is not 30001 and 40000, the program with exit right away. Same as 
machine name, we will use gethostbyname() function to check if the machine 
is avalabe or not.

We are going to use semaphores in this part as well as apply the list 
from the assignemt 1.

list will be used for store data which we are going to send and the data we 
received.There will be a semaphores p() call which make suspend the semaphonres
 in the begining of the thread and a v() call by the end of the thread.

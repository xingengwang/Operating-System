For part A, we need to create one parent thread and M child thread as required.
To create a correct thread, we need to understand how thread work.

We will work in two seperate operating system which are linux and windows.  Both of them
own its thread. In part A1, we will run code on windows and in parta2 and parta3 we will run
run on linux.

Since phase 1 we only need to get the skeleton program, print out something for child thread
to prove if it is working is a good idea.  Before writing code, we should learn about how 
CreateThread() work, what each input represent and find the correct data.  

The other thing we should remember is that when you create a child thread from a parent 
thread, Sleep() is important because if there is no Sleep() called, parent thread will 
run continously regardless to the status of child thread.  

			  parent thread

      child thread<--------------------------------->child thread
			      |
			      |
			     \|/
			 parent thread keep running
			 
			 "what might happen withour Sleep()"
			 
			 
			 
For further implement, child thread need to get the running time of child thread.
For this, we can use a function called GetSystemTime(), which is another function for 
Win32 system.  
Number of invocations of child thread is also needed. A counter in the recursive may be 
a good idea.

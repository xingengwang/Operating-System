Part C test plan:


For phase two, all we need to test is the ListAdd, ListInsert, ListAppend, ListPrepend.
Since all the function is suppose to add the node to a list.  First, we should monitor the
number of nodes in the list all the time. We can use a printf of the list->count to do this.
Also, after every operation, check the cur item since all 4 operation suppose to make new
 item the current item.  Some marginal situation should be considered, like when list is 
 empty, or only one item in the list, or only two item in the list.

cause we find out the problem in bash in a late time, we just test the program in command line

1.try make the size of the square to 0 with only one thread
result expcet: the Square should be call 1 times.

2. run same input twice
result expect: the square number called should be the same.

3. try different size number to obtain the different between time usage
result expect: the biger size number should result a higer time usage.

4.try a very short deadline and a enough deadline with other element no change
result expect: the short deadline number should result in no data output.

5. try use different thread number but other input are the same.
